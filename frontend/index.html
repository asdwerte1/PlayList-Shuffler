            <h3>What is this?</h3>
            <p>A simple app designed to shuffle your Spotify playlists</p>
            <p>The Spotify shuffle algorithm often puts bias on songs you play often leading to hearing the same songs
                over and over</p>
            <p>By using this, you will give your playlists a randomised order, creating a more true shuffe experience
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="animate fade-in-up ">
            <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
            <p>First click the authenticate button below - this will ask you to sign into Spotify and grant permission
                to access your acount</p>
            <p>Your playlists will then be displayed below</p>
            <p>Click the playlist you wish to shuffle, a confirmation will appear when this is done</p>
            <p>Go to the playlist in Spotify and ensure the sort is set to "Custom", then simply play from the top
