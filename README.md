# PlayList-Shuffler
An app to shuffle a given playlist into a random order - designed to combat the limited shuffle algorithm that Spotify has.

Ever noticed that the spotify shuffle algorithm always play the same songs over and over? Even on that huge playlist of yours? This is because the shuffle adds weight to songs you play more...which leads to hearing the same songs more.

Instead, the aim of this app will be to truely randomise the order of your playlists.

How?

Simply use the app to randomise the orde of the playlists if choice, ensure it is sorted by "Custom" in Spotify, then simply play from the top down!

## Changes:

* Early version of backend app developed - able to authenticate Spotify account and access playlists

## Current work:

* Update backend app beyond current terminal app style to server script
* Develop front end
